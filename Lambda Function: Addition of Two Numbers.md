# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
f = lambda x, y: x + y
print(f(a, b))
## Output

## Result
The Python program using a lambda function to add two user-provided integers has been executed successfully, and the output has been verified.
