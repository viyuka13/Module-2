# Functions in Python: Modulo Calculator

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their **modulo** using the `%` operator.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a function called `result` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`.
2. Inside the function, compute the modulo using `a % b`.
3. Print the result of the modulo operation.
4. Get two integer inputs from the user.
5. Call the `result` function with the user-provided values.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
def result(a, b):
    print(a % b)

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
result(a, b)
## Output

## Result
The Python program to compute the modulo of two user-provided integers using a function has been executed successfully, and the output has been verified.
